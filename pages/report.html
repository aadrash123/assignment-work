				<p> My experience learning HTML and CSS was interesting.
I feel like the HTML was not as difficult compared to CSS. I learned different HTML 5 tags like header, footer, nav, sections. I learned how to use full image as background. I also learned modern techniques like Flex and Grid for layouts. I also learned how to create forms with different form inputs. I also learned how to link different pages and use images.

Initially it was difficult for me how to start the project, how to structure the folders. Later researching about the common ways to structure I was able to do the initial setup.
Working with CSS was fun but was also difficult as I needed to spent more time fixing different styles. It was quite tricky for handling the responsiveness but with the grid layout, it was not that difficult. I found Grid Layout to be more useful as compared to the traditional way of creating layouts using the float.
Ankit Thapa who taught about this model is good engertic teacher he is so humble he used too sayy about this if we didnt understand he used to repeat it twice it is good for us so it became abit easier due to our teacher .I uses index to make html layout in which header,section are present and in header i uses navigation and logo and there are on paragraph in section.
Here css is inside styles.css folder and for to make page responsive media queries are used.It was great experience learing about web development module. We use different font syle to make the pages attractive and we uses different forrm in contact to full fill the information about the person.We uses modern techniques like flex and grid for layouts and we learned how to create differnet forms with difffernet forms inputs.
I learned how to  link different pages and images using different css.I learned different HTML 5 tags like header, footer,nav,sections.validation is done using this site < a href="https://validator.w3.org>Validation</a>.
